       Congratulations on getting into college, sweetie! You’re finally all moved into your first apartment and all ready for school, and I have never been more proud of you. So you don’t worry, I paid off your first month’s rent. Be sure to call and tell me everything that happens. Best of luck! Love you!
       	Love, Mom
